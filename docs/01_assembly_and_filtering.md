# 01. Assembly and filtering

Processing of 3RADseq data for the whitespotted wedgefish (*Rhynchobatus djiddensis*, RD) and the bottlenose wedgefish (*R. australiae*, RA). Both species were sequenced on one NovaSeq S4 run (paired-end, 2 x 150 bp). The pipeline is the same for both, so it is shown once with `SPECIES` as a variable; differences are listed at the end.

Steps marked **[HPC]** were run on a cluster and **[R]** in R. Software: FastQC 0.11.5, Cutadapt 1.9.1, Stacks 2.59, VCFtools 0.1.14, RADstackshelpR 0.1.0.

## Final datasets

| Dataset | Species | SNPs | n | Missingness | Filters | Use |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| RD_set1 | *R. djiddensis* | 27 366 | 47 | 4.83% | MAC >= 3, FS1 | primary |
| RD_set2 | *R. djiddensis* | 18 942 | 47 | 5.09% | MAC >= 3, FS2 | robustness |
| RA_set1 | *R. australiae* | 27 562 | 71 | 6.32% | MAC >= 3, FS1 | primary |
| RA_set2 | *R. australiae* | 30 380 | 71 | 6.24% | MAC >= 2, FS1 | robustness |

## Settings

```bash
SPECIES=RD                                   # RD or RA
WORKDIR=$HOME/radseq                         # edit
READS=$WORKDIR/${SPECIES}_demultiplex/reads
CORE=$WORKDIR/${SPECIES}_assembly/core
ADAPTER_1=AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCAC
ADAPTER_2=AGATCGGAAGAGCGTCGTGTAGGGAAAGAGTGT
```

## Step 1. Raw data and quality control [HPC]

File integrity was checked with `md5sum -c md5sum.txt`. Each plate was sequenced with two dual-indexing combinations, which were merged before QC.

```bash
cat ${PLATE}-1_*_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz ${PLATE}-2_*_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz > ${PLATE}_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz
cat ${PLATE}-1_*_L001_R2_001.fastq.gz ${PLATE}-2_*_L001_R2_001.fastq.gz > ${PLATE}_L001_R2_001.fastq.gz

fastqc ${PLATE}_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz ${PLATE}_L001_R2_001.fastq.gz
```

## Step 2. Demultiplexing [HPC]

Reads were demultiplexed with `process_radtags` (double-inline barcodes; MspI and BamHI). Untrimmed reads, Cutadapt-trimmed reads and untrimmed reads with the adapters passed to `process_radtags` were compared in R by reads retained per sample, and the last was selected.

```bash
process_radtags \
  -1 ${PLATE}_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz -2 ${PLATE}_L001_R2_001.fastq.gz \
  -i gzfastq -b barcodes.txt --inline_inline \
  -o $READS \
  --adapter_1 $ADAPTER_1 --adapter_2 $ADAPTER_2 --adapter_mm 2 \
  -c -q -r -t 140 -w 0.15 -s 10 \
  --renz_1 mspI --renz_2 bamHI
```

## Step 3. Parameter optimisation (RADstackshelpR) [HPC, then R]

Twenty samples were used (about equal numbers per locality, close to average read depth), with remainder reads (`*.rem.*.fq.gz`) moved out of the directory. Each parameter was varied in turn (m = 3 to 7, M = 1 to 8, n = M-1, M and M+1) and the results visualised in R. The optimal values were **m = 3, M = 3, n = 4**.

```bash
OPTIM=$WORKDIR/${SPECIES}_assembly/optim

for m in {3..7}; do                                  # m
  mkdir -p $OPTIM/denovo.m${m}
  denovo_map.pl --samples $READS --popmap $OPTIM/popmap_optim.txt \
    --out-path $OPTIM/denovo.m${m} --paired -m $m -T 12 \
    -X "populations: --vcf" > $OPTIM/denovo.m${m}/denovo_map.log 2>&1
done

for M in {1..8}; do                                  # M, with m = 3
  mkdir -p $OPTIM/denovo.bigM${M}
  denovo_map.pl --samples $READS --popmap $OPTIM/popmap_optim.txt \
    --out-path $OPTIM/denovo.bigM${M} --paired -m 3 -M $M -T 12 \
    -X "populations: --vcf" > $OPTIM/denovo.bigM${M}/denovo_map.log 2>&1
done

for n in {2..4}; do                                  # n = M-1, M, M+1, with m = 3, M = 3
  mkdir -p $OPTIM/denovo.n${n}
  denovo_map.pl --samples $READS --popmap $OPTIM/popmap_optim.txt \
    --out-path $OPTIM/denovo.n${n} --paired -m 3 -M 3 -n $n -T 12 \
    -X "populations: --vcf" > $OPTIM/denovo.n${n}/denovo_map.log 2>&1
done
```

## Step 4. De novo assembly [HPC, then R]

```bash
OUT=$CORE/denovo_m3_M3_n4; mkdir -p $OUT

denovo_map.pl --samples $READS --popmap $CORE/popmap_full.txt \
  --out-path $OUT --paired -m 3 -M 3 -n 4 -T 12 \
  -X "populations: --vcf" > $OUT/denovo_map.log 2>&1
```

Assembly checks (problematic samples were flagged in R):

```bash
stacks-dist-extract denovo_map.log cov_per_sample | grep -v '^#'          # coverage after ustacks
grep -B 2 -A 3 '^Genotyped' gstacks.log                                   # loci and coverage after gstacks
stacks-dist-extract gstacks.log.distribs effective_coverages_per_sample | grep -v '^#' | cut -f 1-2,4-5,8
```

## Step 5. Filtering

### 5.1 Base filter with `populations` [HPC]

All individuals were treated as one population. Loci had to be present in at least 80% of samples, with maximum observed heterozygosity 0.5 and a minor allele count of at least 3 (R80/Het50/MAC3). For RA_set2 the minor allele count was 2.

```bash
populations --in-path $OUT --out-path $CORE/filtering/base_R80_Het50_MAC3/ \
  --popmap popmap_onepop.txt \
  --min-samples-overall 0.80 --max-obs-het 0.5 --min-mac 3 --vcf
```

### 5.2 Genotype filters with VCFtools [HPC, then R]

Four filter sets were compared in R, and the one with the best balance of missingness and SNP retention (FS1) was used for the primary datasets. FS2 was used for the RD robustness dataset.

| Set | min GQ | min DP | max missing |
|---|---|---|---|
| FS1 | 20 | 5 | 0.8 |
| FS2 | 20 | 8 | 0.8 |
| FS3 | 20 | 8 | 0.9 |
| FS4 | 25 | 10 | 0.9 |

```bash
# FS1 shown; the other sets change only these three values
vcftools --vcf populations.snps.vcf --minGQ 20 --minDP 5 --max-missing 0.8 \
  --recode --recode-INFO-all --out FS1_GQ20_DP5_MISS0.8
```

### 5.3 Remove replicates, high-missingness individuals and outliers [HPC, then R]

Replicates (keeping the replicate with the lowest missingness), individuals with more than 40% missing data and outliers identified in a preliminary PCA in R were removed.

```bash
vcftools --vcf FS1_GQ20_DP5_MISS0.8.recode.vcf --remove remove_list.txt \
  --recode --recode-INFO-all --out FS1_filtered
```

### 5.4 Final dataset [HPC]

The Stacks locus IDs of the filtered SNPs were extracted from the CHROM column of the filtered VCF as a whitelist, and `populations` was rerun on the original assembly to keep one SNP per locus and write the VCF and other formats. The whitelist must contain only the locus IDs, one per line.

```bash
grep -v '^#' FS1_filtered.recode.vcf | cut -f1 | sort -n | uniq > whitelist.txt

populations --in-path $OUT --out-path $CORE/final/popgen1 \
  --popmap popmap_final.txt --whitelist whitelist.txt \
  --write-single-snp --vcf --structure --radpainter
```

Final QC:

```bash
vcftools --vcf populations.snps.vcf --missing-indv
awk 'NR>1 {sum+=$5} END {print sum/(NR-1)}' out.imiss     # mean individual missingness
grep -vc '^#' populations.snps.vcf                          # number of SNPs
```

## Differences between the species

| | RD | RA |
|---|---|---|
| Before assembly | none | six individuals removed because of initial mislabelling |
| Individuals removed after filtering | replicates, individuals with >40% missing data and PCA outliers | same |
| Datasets | set1 (MAC3, FS1), set2 (MAC3, FS2) | set1 (MAC3, FS1), set2 (MAC2, FS1) |
